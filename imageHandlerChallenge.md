# Frontend Developer Challenge

Welcome to the Frontend Developer Challenge! ðŸš€

## The Challenge

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to design and implement a cutting-edge web-based image handler. We want you to showcase your frontend skills and create a delightful user experience.

### Web Application Requirements

1. **Image Gallery:** Design a web page to display a list of all uploaded images, showing only the image metadata. Provide a convenient link to open the full image.

2. **Image Viewer:** Develop a web page to view a specific image. The actual image should be prominently displayed for the user's visual pleasure.

3. **User Interaction:** On the image viewer page, empower users to add comments. Keep in mind that comments might disappear upon reloading the page. Your focus here is on the frontend magic!

### Design Principles

- **Responsiveness is Key:** While we don't demand pixel perfection for every mobile layout, we encourage you to embrace a responsive mindset. Make it look good on all devices!

- **Tech Stack:** Implement the frontend of the web application using ReactJS. You have the freedom to emulate a backend using functions that retrieve dummy data.

### What We Expect

This challenge is deliberately open-ended. We want you to unleash your creativity, delivering a design that is not only visually appealing but also intuitive. Craft an experience that users will find satisfying and memorable.

## Deliverables

- **GitHub Repository:** Share a repository containing your project code. Include clear instructions to ensure anyone can run your masterpiece.

- **Project Reflection:** Provide a brief description of your work. Share insights into the challenges you faced and the improvements you envision.

- **Time Estimate:** Aim to spend approximately ~4 hours on this test. Once you hit this mark, you can gracefully halt your coding adventure. We'll then schedule a post-mortem call to discuss your thoughts on how you would have continued the project.
